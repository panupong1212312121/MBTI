# MBTI

This workshop is originated from my idea

In thailand , when I apply for job .HR often send this link "https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test" and inform me to test it 

I spend about or less 10 minutes to test my MBTI again and again because I can't remember my MBTI.

I test my MBTI many times.This means I waste time to test it many times so I think Do I have any method to test it by spending less time.

Thus , I have an idea to reduce questions'test.If the test has less questions I definitely take less time to test it and it's better if the result is still precise.

Finally , I create this workshop from my idea that I said above.I use Deep learning to build model which predicts MBTI by using only 20 features (20 questions)

From 60 questions to 20 questions , It's means I reduce feature more than 2/3 and still get precise model to predict any MBTI by saving many time.
